The chess classifier will not be runnable on a system that doesnt have cudnn and other nvida toolsets.

python ChessClassifier.py test - run in a command line to see results of classifier.

transform and corner_detection.py are visual components, these should be runnable.

To run the chess engine, go to Chess_Main, and run the program.
